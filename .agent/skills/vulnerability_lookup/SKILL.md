# [49] vulnerability_lookup
**Goal:** Proactive security auditing.

## Workflow
- **Security Scans:** Run `bandit` and `safety` on the Python environment daily.
- **Dependency Audit:** Identify outdated or insecure packages in `requirements.txt`.
- **Auto-Patch:** Autonomously create a patch or upgrade PR when a vulnerability is detected.

## Constraints
- High-severity vulnerabilities must trigger an immediate system halt.
