# [55] performance_profiler
**Goal:** Maximum execution efficiency.

## Workflow
- **Profilling:** Profile the Finance App analysis engine using `cProfile`.
- **Bottleneck Detection:** Identify bottlenecks in data processing loops.
- **Optimization:** Implement optimizations (vectorization, caching) to reduce latency.

## Constraints
- Target <1s response time for standard data queries.
