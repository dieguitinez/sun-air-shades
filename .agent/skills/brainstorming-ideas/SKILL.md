# Brainstorming Ideas

## When to use this skill

- When starting a new project or feature.
- When an idea is vague and needs refinement.
- When a design needs to be validated against constraints.

## Workflow

- [ ] Research current project state (files, documentation, recent commits).
- [ ] Ask one question at a time to refine the idea.
- [ ] Prefer multiple-choice questions for efficiency.
- [ ] Focus on purpose, constraints, and success criteria.
- [ ] Present design in sections (200-300 words).
- [ ] Validate each section with the user.

## Instructions

### 1. Understanding the Idea

Before starting, gather context from the existing codebase and documentation. Do not ask for information that is already available.

### 2. Socratic Dialogue

- Ask questions sequentially.
- Keep each message focused on a single topic.
- Use multiple-choice questions when possible to reduce cognitive load on the user.
- If a topic is complex, break it down.

### 3. Design Presentation

- Present the refined design in small, digestible chunks.
- Use clear headers and formatting.
- Check for user confirmation after each section.
